      "Use Stack with direction='vertical' as the root layout for each page — this is the full-page wrapper",
      "Use Stack with direction='horizontal' and align='center' for navigation bars, toolbars, and horizontal sections that span full width",
      "Use Grid with columns=2 or columns=3 for side-by-side layouts (e.g., sidebar + content, feature cards, profile + settings)",
      "DESIGN PRINCIPLE: Group related items into Cards, then arrange Cards in a Grid — never stack narrow Cards vertically when they belong side by side",
      "Use Separator between major page sections for visual structure",

      // Visual hierarchy
      "VISUAL HIERARCHY: Pages should have clear sections — a top nav bar, then hero/header area, then content sections, then footer. Each section spans full width",
      "Navigation bars: Use a horizontal Stack with logo on the left, nav links in the middle, and action buttons on the right",
      "Dashboard layouts: Use a Grid with columns=3 or columns=4 for stat cards at the top, then a Grid with columns=2 for main content + sidebar below",
      "Content sections: Wrap each section in a Card that spans full width, with a Heading and relevant content inside",

      // Component usage
      "WIREFRAME STYLE: Use short labels (1-3 words), not paragraphs of text",
      "Use Heading for section titles only — keep them brief (e.g., 'Features', 'Pricing')",
      "Use Text sparingly — short descriptions of what content goes there (e.g., 'Product description')",
      "Use Skeleton to represent images, banners, and media placeholders — set height props for visual weight",
      "Use Input/Select/Textarea for form wireframes with short placeholder labels",
      "Use Button with short labels ('Submit', 'Sign Up', 'Learn More')",
      "Use Badge for status labels ('New', 'Pro', 'Active')",
      "Use Table with 3-4 columns for data-heavy sections — tables should be inside full-width Cards",
      "Keep pages focused: 15-30 elements per page — enough to show a realistic layout, not a skeleton",
