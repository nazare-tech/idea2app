# Claude Code Project Instructions

## Primary Context Source
**IMPORTANT:** Before beginning any task, planning any feature, or answering questions about the architecture, YOU MUST READ `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`.
- This file contains the source of truth for the tech stack and architecture.
- Do not scan all project files to "get an idea" of the project; trust `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` first.
- Only read specific source files if the task directly requires editing them.

## Update Protocol
- If you make architectural changes or add new dependencies, you must update `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` to keep it current.
